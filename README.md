CRUD method would be the best way of writing, reading, updating, and deleting data from a database. During the class we explored setting up our CRUD methods using python script.
By implementing the CRUD methods first the your able to get to the data on the database. Thus when its time to setup the UI, one is able to directily pull data from the source and implement
it on the UI. This allows the user to see the UI for what it is and get a good grasp of what is needed to improve the UI. I really didn't approach this assignment all to differently from previous ones 
I found that it was pretty straight forward of downloading a datatable, writing scripts to see/interact with said datatable, and then implment a UI to further inhance the users ablility to read said data.
Computer science is all about making large amounts of data more readiable to the average user. By creating interfaces as well as functions that are able to make data easily digestable to the average user,
people are able to comprehend bigger and bigger concepts or things at much more globle scale.
